LEARNING SCALA

1. Main scala language number types -
	A. AnyVal - Double, Int, Long
	B. ScalaNumber - BigDecimal and BigInt

2. Classic Division in scala 
	a. The answer of classic division = 10 / 20 = 0
	b. The answer of True division = 10.0 / 20 = 0.5
	c. The answer of True division = 10 / 20.5 = 0.4878048780487805
	d. The answer of True division = 100.9 / 20.5 = 4.921951219512195

3. Values (Val) are immutable. Once they are assigned they cannot be changed. Variables (var) can be reassigned. while reassigning you must use the same datatype.

4. We need to use double quotes in scala for defining strings. We cannot use single quotes. String Interpolation refers to substitution of defined variables or expressions in a given String with respected values. String Interpolation provides an easy way to process String literals. 
Example -

    val x = 20
    val y = 10
    
    // without s interpolator
    val str1 = "Sum of $x and $y is ${x+y}"
    
    // with s interpolator
    val str2 = s"Sum of $x and $y is ${x+y}"
    
    println("str1: "+str1)
    println("str2: "+str2)

OUTPUT - 
	str1: Sum of $x and $y is ${x+y}
	str2: Sum of 20 and 10 is 30
